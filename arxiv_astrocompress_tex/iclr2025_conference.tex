\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The site conditions that make astronomical observatories in space and on the ground so desirable---cold and dark---demand a physical remoteness that leads to limited data transmission capabilities. Such transmission limitations directly bottleneck the amount of data acquired and in an era of costly modern observatories, any improvements in lossless data compression has the potential scale to billions of dollars worth of additional science that can be accomplished on the same instrument. Traditional lossless methods for compressing astrophysical data are manually designed. Neural data compression, on the other hand, holds the promise of learning compression algorithms end-to-end from data and outperforming classical techniques by leveraging the unique spatial, temporal, and wavelength structures of astronomical images.
%
This paper introduces AstroCompress (\url{https://huggingface.co/AstroCompress}): a neural compression challenge for astrophysics data, featuring four new datasets (and one legacy dataset) with 16-bit unsigned integer imaging data in various modes: space-based, ground-based, multi-wavelength, and time-series imaging. We provide code to easily access the data and benchmark seven lossless compression methods  (three neural and four non-neural, including all practical state-of-the-art algorithms).
Our results on lossless compression indicate that lossless neural compression techniques can enhance data collection at observatories, and provide guidance on the adoption of neural compression in scientific applications. 
% YY{I'm commenting this out as it's non-essential and the abstract is already quite long} Though the scope of this paper is restricted to lossless compression, we also comment on the potential exploration of lossy compression methods in future studies.

%\section*{Limitations and Broader Impacts}

%Limitations of our dataset include a lack of spectroscopic data, radio astronomy data or floating-point data. In addition, we believe that the significant time delay in between our SDSS image exposures may not be representative of other optical telescopes that may do back-to-back exposures of the same region. Such a dataset may bring forth significant compression gains, the way we have shown for back-to-back infrared imaging via JWST frame differencing.

%Limitations of our neural codecs include the marginal gains seen in comparison with JPEG-XL, the relative difficulty of deploying these codecs, and their current lack of generalizability.

%By improving compression for astrophysics, we can make telescopes operationally more efficient as more data can be collected and transmitted. Since our algorithms are lossless, we do not foresee any negative consequences on scientific research or society.

%SCOPE. This track welcomes all work on data-centric machine learning research (DMLR), covering ML datasets and benchmarks as well as algorithms, tools, methods, and analyses for working with ML data. This includes but is not limited to:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item New datasets, or carefully and thoughtfully designed (collections of) datasets based on previously available data.
%    \item Data generators and reinforcement learning environments.
%    \item Data-centric AI methods and tools, e.g. to measure and improve data quality or utility, or studies in data-centric AI that bring important new insight.
%    \item Advanced practices in data collection and curation that are of general interest even if the data itself cannot be shared.
%    \item Frameworks for responsible dataset development, audits of existing datasets, identifying significant problems with existing datasets and their use
%    \item Benchmarks on new or existing datasets, as well as benchmarking tools.
%    \item In-depth analyses of machine learning challenges and competitions (by organizers and/or participants) that yield important new insight.

\subsection*{Reproducibility Statement}
Our experimental results rely on already published, publicly available compression models. In cases where the architecture was modified to be compatible with new data formats, we were explicit about the alterations described in Sec.~\ref{sec:experiments} and additional architecture and training details in the supplementary material Sec.~\ref{sec:protocol}. We have also released the code base used for experiments in Sec.~\ref{sec:protocol} along with the data sets in the abstract.
